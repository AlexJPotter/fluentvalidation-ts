// Slightly hacky workaround for the fact that a generic type parameter <T extends U>
// does not limit values of T to having **only** the properties of U, but rather requires
// that they have **at least** the properties specified in U. This is currently used for
// getting the right typing on the `.ruleForTransformed` methods, so that an object property
// can't be mapped to an object property of a different type (in particular, one that has
// more properties, since these won't be present in the `ValidationErrors` object).
