While **fluentvalidation-ts** was originally developed with Formik integration in mind, [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) has become increasingly popular in the React community. Thankfully, wonderful members of the community have contributed a [fluentvalidation-ts resolver](https://github.com/react-hook-form/resolvers?tab=readme-ov-file#fluentvalidation-ts) for React Hook Form, allowing you to integrate it seamlessly with no effort required on your part!
