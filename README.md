## Overview

Front-end validation is a must-have for any project that involves forms, but the requirements vary hugely. You might have a simple sign-up form with a few text fields, or a complex configuration page with collections and deeply nested fields.

There are plenty of libraries out there which help you to solve the problem of front-end validation, but all the ones I've tried have felt lacking in one aspect or another - whether that's TypeScript support, their capacity to handle complex requirements, or the ability to define your own reusable validation logic.

So I wrote `fluentvalidation-ts`, a tiny library that is:

- Designed for **TypeScript**
- Simple yet powerful
- Fully extensible

Whatever your validation needs, `fluentvalidation-ts` can handle them.

## Docs

Full documentation, including a tutorial and a number of useful guides, is available at the [official fluentvalidation-ts website](https://fluentvalidation-ts.alexpotter.dev).

### Requirements

This library has been written in, and for, **TypeScript**. You can still use `fluentvalidation-ts` without TypeScript, but the primary benefit of having strongly-typed validation rules is lost.

If using TypeScript (strongly recommended), you must be on TypeScript version **`2.9`** or later.

### Installation

Using Yarn:

```
yarn add fluentvalidation-ts
```

Using NPM:

```
npm i --save fluentvalidation-ts
```

**Note:** `fluentvalidation-ts` has been written with first-class support for TypeScript, so there's no need to install types!

### Example Usage

```typescript
import { Validator } from 'fluentvalidation-ts';

type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

class PersonValidator extends Validator<Person> {
  constructor() {
    super();

    this.ruleFor('name') // This is type-safe! (Argument is of type 'name' | 'age')
      .notEmpty()
      .withMessage('Please enter your name');

    this.ruleFor('age')
      .greaterThanOrEqualTo(0)
      .withMessage('Age cannot be negative');
  }
}

const validator = new PersonValidator();

validator.validate({ name: '', age: 25 });
// { name: 'Please enter your name' }

validator.validate({ name: 'Alex', age: -1 });
// { age: 'Age cannot be negative' }

validator.validate({ name: '', age: -1 });
// { name: 'Please enter your name', age: 'Age cannot be negative' }
```
